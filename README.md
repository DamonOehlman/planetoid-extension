# Planetoid Extension

This is a chrome extension for helping with turn management of [planets.nu](http://planets.nu) [VGA Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_Planets).

# Features

To date the following features have been implemented.  At this stage, all helpers work pretty much to my liking and are not yet configurable.

- Set autobuild targets for owned planets (when planet management screen opened)
- Mark planet colors to override what was stored in the turn data (fixes: http://planets.uservoice.com/forums/136520-general/suggestions/2523613-change-custom-planet-colour-not-changing-when-plan)
